# Stone Paper Scissors Game
# 🚀 Project Overview
This project is a fully responsive Stone Paper Scissors game that I built using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and CSS animations. The game features dynamic content that changes across multiple screens, providing a seamless and interactive user experience. Additionally, the game leverages session storage to retain the player's score even after the page is reloaded, showcasing the use of persistent state management in a web application.

# 🧠 What I Learned
This project allowed me to deepen my understanding of:

**Responsive Web Design:** Ensuring that the game looks and functions well on any device.

**JavaScript DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically updating content and handling user interactions.

**State Management with Session Storage:** Persisting game state across sessions to improve user experience.

**CSS Animations:** Creating engaging and smooth transitions to make the game more interactive.

# 🎮 How to Play

**Choose your move:** 
Stone, Paper, or Scissors.

The computer will randomly select its move.

The winner is determined based on the classic game rules.

Your score will be updated and saved across sessions.

Clicking on the Next Button will give you with final result based on your current scores.

# 💡 Challenges and Solutions
One of the main challenges I faced was ensuring the game score persisted even after the page reloads. I tackled this by using session storage effectively, which allowed me to maintain the user's score seamlessly across multiple sessions. 

Another main challenge was the Hurray Page star animation where i need to create a curved motion for the stars. This was solved by making the image container to move in X axis and the image to move in Y Axis and both at different speeds. This way a curve was generated and by controlling the speed we can create different smooth curves.
